# True control comes after knowledge.

This book introduces **established concepts in the computer ecosystem**, so you can use them to have more control over your own computers and know any implications when interacting beyond.

## What *is* IT50?

IT stands for Information Technology, a phrase less used in the 2020s. The reason behind this decline is the prosperity of services making users ignorant of the technical aspects. In this project, we bring those back to everyone who wishes to know.

Our goal comes from the belief that everyone should be able to control their own computer systems as much as possible. To empower that, we aim to give readers a high-level cognition of how things work. This project focuses exclusively on the established concepts in computer software.

We are aware of many other introductory guides, and we know why we are special. A professional software user does not have to be a programmer, in the same sense as drivers do not need to know how to make cars. Learning how things work at a *certain* level is the sweet spot for the vast majority of people, and this guide is built right at this sweet spot. If you are looking for a programming guide, then this is not the right place, although [it would be very beneficial to have a look](https://github.com/IT50/engineers-that-need-to-read-it50).

We also try to build the best cognitive framework for our readers. We do not oversimplify concepts or make things unnecessarily amusing.

Indeed, driving is a useful skill, and so is computer literacy. We are sure you are going to find its significance.
